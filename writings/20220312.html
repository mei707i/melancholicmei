  Hello.<br>
  <br />
  So long, and I am still here.<br>
  <br />
  Today was an interview, and it went shit. This has nothing to do with it, I've been like this since a long time, probably from the moment I was born. Wasn't loved much in the paternal family, so I cut relations with them. Its okay. I am not sad or anything. Just dissapointed with myself. I am so used to failure. I am a fucking failure. I never made my parents proud because of any achievement, I haven't done anything in my life yet. Piece of shit.
  <br>
  <br />
  I told someone about this. He told me that I should talk. Talk what? I don't even feel like I live in my home anymore. I don't belong in my college, I am so out of place. I see people talking to each other, cherishing and making memories while I am sitting at a corner doing nothing. It has always been like this. What can I do? No one wants to talk with me. No one finds me interesting. I am sure when I speak to them they are just waiting for me to go away. I am an eyesore maybe. Self believe, optimism, self love all the fucking bullshit isn't for me. I am meant to be like this, a bad bean which must be eliminated. What's the point anyway? What's in it for me? Self Love? Fuck that shit.
  <br>
  <br />
  It looks like I have a solution. I have to be independent first so I don't affect my parents. Push them away, make them find their own happiness. When the right moment comes I will end my life. A sacrifice for a better world. A world free of scum like me.
