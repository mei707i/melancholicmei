    Hello.<br>
    <br />
    Come, Sweeth Death.<br>
    <br />
    Death, the only way to get myself out of my misery. A good way to cleansing. If I ever kill myself, there is good chance I will, soon. I have some ideas.
    <br>
    <br />
    I can die by jumping off of a high ground, the old fashioned way. I can die by carbon monoxide overdose or laughing gas overdose. Electrocution is a good idea too. I'm not in USA, so no guns. Simple, just consume poison. I got a much better idea. Sleeping pills overdose.
    <br>
    <br />
    Euthansia might become the ray of hope for me. Won't you hold in your arms if I ever call you, oh sweet death? I know this universe doesn't give a shit about me, no one does. I don't wanna exist. I am just holding to the hope that nature will do its work on its own.
