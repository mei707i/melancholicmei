Hello Again.<br>
<br />
Initialisation.<br>
<br />
The reason why I created all this, to get done with some stuff which I have to do. First of all, I need to improve my language. Right now, I speak broken English. I will start with basic English grammar, work my way as I learn other things like pronounciation and vocabulary. I can start reading books aloud daily. I don't speak much. I don't wish to. I know my voice will go unheard. Just like it is, now, and how always has been. I don't know. Maybe talking to myself aloud might help. Who knows? One task at a time. <br>
<br /> 
I also want to improve my handwriting for some reason. Probably spending some time of day will get the job done. Probably will help me to stay healthy so I can get those things done properly. <br>
<br />
I also need to reduce my time spending on trying to talk to people. The problem is not them. It's me. I can't maintain happiness. I go to college. I meet them, they are nice to me, as I come back home, I am hit with the crippling reality. I am a loser. I have achieved nothing. I don't wish to burden my parents anymore. I don't wish to make anyone sad with my existence. I am fking noboby anyways. I need to rise to the state of taking decisions somehow, so things can be less painful.<br>
<br />
Looks like I am in a much better mood today. Maybe I am slowly accepting the truth. <br>
<br />
bye. for now. <br>
