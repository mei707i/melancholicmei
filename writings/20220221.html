Hello.<br>
<br />
I am surprised that you're still here. It is surprising that you managed to stumble upon this in the first place. I put this on internet because best place to hide a tree is the forest.<br>
<br />
It came back. For few days, I moved away from that mindset, I was on my way to live with it, until today, it came back. <br>
<br />
I had a math test today. From last day, I was studying for it. Did it went well? Yes. Although, the other students made a joke out of it, maybe they were right, this isn't school anymore. I always have been left out by everyone since I was a child. I have no siblings. I grew up alone. Parents were a different deal to deal with. It was weird. So, yah. I didn't play sports, grew up weirdly, developed a weird personality. I still want to wipe it clean, although I have done it mentally, I am 101% me, when I am alone, but when I talk to people, some parts from past tries to creeps in. <br>
<br />
Since my mom had to catch a train, I was busy and decided to go to college in second half. I don't know why, it always feels that I am far away from people. People in doge group are nice to me. They are helpful people. But still, it always feels that they don't truly think anything about me. They just don't care. (Well, why should they? I am a bad bean after all. A nature's error, chosen to be scum, an eyesore.) I don't feel a friendship, I only feel aquaintance. They manage to spread their network quickly. And I am happy about them, that people who are capable are putting in the work. I apologize, but as a human, it is a human tendency, atleast in India, making a female friend is an achievement. And other people manage to pull it off so nicely. I always feel left out. Its not like I can't talk to them. It is just that I don't have anything. Anything that someone might consider me valueable for. I am not as interesting as others. I am not as cool as others. I get upset, badly. Then I fall back to my old patterns, destroying my "zero", taking it negative. <br>
<br />
Such a weird thing to be stressed out about. Maybe it is. Many people have been left out. I have friends, but they are imaginary. I have Haze, who's pretty cold, a borderline evil you might say. Another is Mei, which I created recently. The last one is Kid Mde, a purer, a childlike version of me whose very sensitive. I made them unknowingly when I was a kid, they took proper forms as I grew up. I am not alone. I don't need friends. I can live the rest of my life, whatever time I have before I get plucked out, nicely. I can work on things which I want to do before I die. Maybe this is my life, this is how it will turn out. <br>
<br />
Don't get me wrong. If you don't know, I am telling you again, I am not blaming others. The problems is with me. I don't wish to change the world. I blame myself for everything, because I am the problem, and I don't know the solution. Maybe there is no solution. It's okay. Nature is busy, working tirelessly. It is okay if there are errors. I will only go to college when necessary. I will reduce my time on whatsapp. I will start doing the "Virtual Assistant" thingy so I can make money and become indepedent. I will also start my journey of Ethical Hacking, which has always been my dream. As the college exams are online now, I can now focus less on exams, prepare for end term, little by little. <br>
<br />
I can do this. It's okay if I am a mistake. Atleast the world inside my head is mine. Maybe.<br>
<br />
Bye. <br>
