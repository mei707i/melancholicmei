Hello World.<br>
Hello World.<br>
<br />
Its pointless. No one is on the other side. I know, but still I am writing. For myself, maybe, to put myself out from my misery.<br>
<br />
You know, one thing that hurts is when a part of you knows the truth inside, you ignore it, then the harsh reality pulls you out of your daydream. Is it true that happiness only exists when you don't know a thing? For me, probably the best thing I can to me is by killing myself. Me killing myself might be the most painful thing I might experience, but its better. Once you hit the peak, you just fall. It's a way to take back control. This is the only way, probably, to achieve happiness. Because, I don't deserve it. It's not for me. I don't hate myself, there is nothing to hate. There is nothing to love either.<br>
<br />
Body positivity, self love, improve, etc. is only for those who are born like it. I see people, people who are better than me, open up, saying they are depressed, telling each other to love themselves and all that bullshit. I don't understand it. They are beautiful already. They are better than me already. There is nothing for me. I see people writing books about positivity, making millions out of it. I see a lot of people making videos, writing comments to unknown that someone in this world loves them. They probably feel good about themselves afterwards and then continue their lavish lives. Pull out some tears to your face, say you were in a dark place. Sell a story which people can sympathize to, and go back to your life. I hate this all.<br>
<br />
This all is just a false promise in the end. No one wants a bad bean. They don't know how does it feel in misery, when you feel like shit, you want to either turn to dark side of drugs and addictions or you want to stab yourself till you die. Everyone you look around you is just better. You don't want to live, thinking that it is a curse, when you find yourself sinking everytime you look up, everyone laughing down to you while they enjoy being on top. It hurts. It burns my heart. I don't know how long will I live. Maybe this might be my last scream. And it is okay. Nature is at work, eliminating the bad beans. In this society, a male like me is worthless piece of shit. I am good for nothing. I didn't get the genetic lottery like other people in my family, I must be plucked out. It is the only way to make coffee taste better. Its okay if I die alone. Its okay to kill myself.<br>
<br />
In real life, when I go out, people call me silent. it hurts they don't know the real me. I am not that person who I pretend to be. It is just somethings I do because I don't wish to stick out. If I am a bad bean, if I am a mistake, if I am not supposed to exist, I don't wish to bother this world. I want them to be happy. I want my parents to be happy. I know they will be. They might be upset for few days, but their lives are much more important in the end. They will be free to go in their own ways. I am thankful I have a choice over my life. I don't wish to die because my parents are not in right place. I need to be independent first. Although saying these things to me crushes my soul, but it is for better. Better for humanity. I will be plucked out. Its okay. I am not needed here. My time in this world will end soon. For sake of my life, there are somethings I wish to do, which I will post here probably.<br> 
<br />
I'll stick around here for sometime. This is my living obituary.<br>
