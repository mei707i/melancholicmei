  Hello.<br>
  <br />
  End of the month is near. My mid semester exams are near.<br>
  <br />
  A weird thing happend the day before yesterday's night. I was just being me, the normal me, I made some comments on people as I usually do. I had a weird fight, it was totally one sided, the other side was constantly telling me to die, etc. She even tried to hurt a male ego. Sadly, I have none. Because I am not normal. No one can break me if I break myself first. I have always been ignored, by the other branches of the family, probably I never lived upto their expections. The girl told me to not to exist, kill myself. I am done with it already. I know I am a bad bean in a good heap of coffee beans and I must be separated. I must be eliminated. But I'll let the one who created me do the cleanup. I don't want to hurt other people. I don't really know why she said all those stuff to me in the first place. I did not hurt anyone. After some conversations with other people, I found that she actually mistook me for someone else and emptied her rounds on me for no reason. I am not blaming anyone. It is okay. I am meant to be like this. A lot of people in the past have told me that I have a funny stupid face. I used to ignore them because I thought it doesn't matter. It does matter. It is an indication that I am the bad bean. People do truly hate me. If I die right now, at this moment, no one would actually care. I am a mistake in the first place.<br>
  <br />
  This is what I am going to do from now. I am a stupid person for letting heymde exist in the first place. I am going to reduce my social media influence. I am going to focus on gaining knowledge and making money, so I can improve my life, interfere with less people for the amount of time which I have left in this planet. I am not going to talk much on social and real life. Someone who helped me to talk to her said that I should not close myself. What else is the option? It is easy to say stuff like "people care about you", "someone loves you", self love bullshit when you have a privileges in the first place. YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT? I FUCKING HATE THE LIFE I AM LIVING RIGHT NOW. IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE TO DISAPPER FROM EVERYONE'S LIFE IF IT DIDN'T HAD CONSEQUENCES. I FUCKING HATE ME! I WISH TO DIE! I HAVE DONE NOTHING IN MY LIFE! I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF WHY THE FUCK I BREATHE? WHY CAN'T I JUST DIE? I AM JUST A PIECE OF SHIT AND A FUCKING LOSER IN MY LIFE. After all, my opinions don't matter. I don't matter. I need to shut the fuck up. I am just a fucking nobody. No one will ever give a shit about me. This is how I am going to die, unloved, uncared and alone. <br>
  <br />
  I need to put more restrictions around me. This is the only way.<br>
